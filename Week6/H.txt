In this video, we will discuss OpenGL's support for parametric curves and surfaces, and GLU's support for NURBS.

These slides are very dense with information, so I won't provide much commentary. A careful read of the slides, while referring to the OpenGL documentation, provide enough information to implement the presented information.

OpenGL uses what they call evaluators to support and sample parametric curves. 

OpenGL supports Bezier curves and surfaces natively, so B-splines must be converted to Bezier curves.  See the video on NURBS for a description on how to do this conversion.

OpenGL also allows for various levels of sampling.

--4--
You can use glMap1 to pass in the parameters of a Bezier curve including the sampling and the control points.

--5--
glMap binds a curve for evaluation. glEvalCoord1 does the sampling of the bound curve.

glMapGrid and glEvalMesh1 are shortcuts for sampling evenly spaced steps.

--6--
glMap2 does the same as glMap1, except for 2 curves that can be evaluated as a surface.

--7--
Sampling a surface is then performed in the same manner as a curve.

Evenly spaced surfaces have the equivalent grid and mesh calls.

--8--
Here is some example code for rendering a Bezier surface.

--9--
The previous example can be extended to support texture coordinates as well as vertex positions.  Note the sepatate call to glMap2.

--10--
The OpenGL Utility Library provides support for NURBS, which is built on top of the OpenGL evaluator methods.

The basic algorithm is outlined here.

--11--
Since NURBS are much more complicated than Bezier curves, there are more function calls that need to be made to setup and evaluate them.

Listed here are the descriptions for creating and deleting a NURBS renderer, as well as setting properties.

--12--
Here are the remaining calls to defining the NURBS and gluNurbsSurface performs the rendering.

--13--
As you can see here, more complex surfaces are supported with NURBS.

--14--
And here is an example of rendering a heart-shaped NURBS curve using the glu calls we just outlined.

--15--
There is even support for the Utah Teapot, seen here.

--16--
And here is the Utah teapot rendered using 3 subdivisions.

This concludes this video.
